Chapter 2 notes (see chapter 2.2 p.47)
The part in yellow: do the questions
They're drills

int main(){
	return 0;
}

int // return type
main // name
() // parameter
return 0; // body
*everything in the body

To compile:
g++ -o [filename] [filename].[filetype]
./ [filename]

$ // 
$USER // says user's name
$PATH // shows a list of directories that lead to the current directory (completley)
EX:
/usr/local/sbin:/user/local/bin:/user ...........foo 
$HOST // says host name

which ls //helps find current user directory btter than $PATH

cd ~ and cd // take you to home directory

Bash commands on campuswire #  


//////////
Parts of a function
Every function has four parts
(see ยง2.2, p.47):

A return type
A name
A list of parameters
A body
Bash environment variables
$USER
$HOSTNAME
$PATH
$PATH is a lists of directories. When you run a command at the bash terminal, bash will look through this list to find the program you want to run. If it's not in any of these directories, you will get an error message.

You can test this by running which somecommand

You can explicitly use ./somecommand to run the one in the current directory.
